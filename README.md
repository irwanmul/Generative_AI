# Generative AI - AI Implementation


## How to Check

## Problems 
- Manual data extraction from thousands of non-standard documents (invoice + receipts combined) was slow and error prone

## Solution
- Build AI system using OpenAI with Web UI interface to automate extraction by Python Streamlit
- Implemented adaptive processing for variated document formats
- Connection to Pelindo Internal Database

## Action Items
- Gather Requirements:
 - - Gather requirements from all Pelindo Managements
- - Weekly Meeting to asses the requirements
- Document Assesments:	
- - Find out every document specification from every departments
- - Use general Logic to Simplify
	
## Development	
 - Integrate Internal Apps with OpenAI API
	- Create LLM logic for AI
	- Train AI for every use case docs
## Monitoring	
	Get sampling from population docs
	Check if the AI extract is relevant or not
