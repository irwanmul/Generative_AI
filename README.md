## Problems 
- Manual data extraction from thousands of non-standard documents (invoice + receipts combined) was slow and error prone

## Solution
- Build AI system using OpenAI with Web UI interface to automate extraction by Python Streamlit
- Implemented adaptive processing for variated document formats
- Connection to Pelindo Internal Database

## Action Items
- Gather Requirements:
 - - Gather requirements from all Pelindo Managements
- - Weekly Meeting to asses the requirements
- Document Assesments:	
- - Find out every document specification from every departments
- - Use general Logic to Simplify
- Development	
- - Integrate Internal Apps with OpenAI API
- - Create LLM logic for AI
- - Train AI for every use case docs
- Monitoring	
- - Get sampling from population docs
- - Check if the AI extract is relevant or not
 
## Key Achievement
- Achieved 80% extraction accuracy at scale
- Reduced manual processing time by 60%
  
## Impact
Deployed to 3 - 5 Departments with 400 - 500 users
